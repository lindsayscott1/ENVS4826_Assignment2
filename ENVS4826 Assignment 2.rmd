## Introduction
This paper looked at the spread of non native species, specifically earthworms, related to the age of roadways in the northern boreal forests of Alberta, Canada. The aims of this study were to determine whether or not earthworms were more likely to be present and farther spread at sites where roads have been there for a long time versus newly built roads. After looking at the relationship between earthworms and the age of the road, the data would then be used to create a spatial model to be used to predict the spread of earthworms over the next 50 years.
